# HyperQube Changelog

This changelog is for versions of our entire platform. Individual services in the platform (v1-web, v2-api, etc) do not have their own independent versions.

We use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

## v1.1.2

- Fixed some buggy license-checking logic that was causing login issues [ch-148](https://app.clubhouse.io/hyperqube/story/148/bug-licenses-are-not-being-detected)

## v1.1.1

## v1.1.0

- No changes from v1.0.0 but we had to start somewhere further because business reasons
