# HyperQube Changelog

This changelog is for versions of our entire platform. Individual services in the platform (v1-web, v2-api, etc) do not have their own independent versions.

We use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

## v1.1.1

- Fixed an overflow bug in v1 design list page [ch-142](https://app.clubhouse.io/hyperqube/story/142/design-cards-overflow-horizontally-without-scrollbar)

## v1.1.0

- Initial release on semver
- No changes from v1.0.0 but we had to start somewhere further because business reasons
